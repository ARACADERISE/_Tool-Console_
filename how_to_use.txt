_____HOW TO USE_____

It depends on how you want to use it really. There is a .py version that has mutliple different parts to it, it also gives you
the creators name, how to install and so on so forth. Not only that but the python version will have more updates. The other way
you can use this amazing terminal application is by bash install.sh to get the F U L L  E X T E N T of the project, you get to
download the tools, run them in-project, and get a feel! How to run? No worries follow the steps below:

First, you need to bash install.sh, then you'll be brought to 3 options: 1. run file.py 2. bash tools.sh and 3. exit. If you type
'1'(exclude the single-quotes) then the program will then execute the .py version of the project. If you type '2' then the program
will boot the tools.sh where you can download the tools. Or if you type '3' you will exit.

Be aware that there is a SAFE_MODE_ONE# mini-terminal that turns on at the end. It has some functionalities to it in case you might 
be interested. Just type 'help' to see the small list of commands you have within the SAFE_MODE_ON# mini-terminal or type Turn_Off
to exit!

NOTE:
_Tool-Console_ is at no fault of copyrighting others work(s), it is 
simply just a Termux tool that is to be installed for hackers to know
and get top tools that is recommended for them.

Thanks,
Developer
